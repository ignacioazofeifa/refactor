Youâ€™re working for an imaginary consulting company. A colleague of yours spent 8.5h implementing a Tennis scoring software. This colleague is ill and you need to take over. You only have 1.5h left in the budget to clean the code and make it maintainable. What will you do?

Again: no HTTP, no database, no randomness. Just pure, tangled logic to refactor. Although the Tennis scoring rules are a little bit more complex than the Gilded Rose kata (in my opinion).

A few characteristics of this exercise:

- Tests are already here, so you can focus on pure refactoring techniques.
- There are 3 variants that showcase different code smells and challenges.
- At the end of the kata, do a retrospective to list what were the smells you spotted and how you refactored the design. Why is it better? How would that help?
